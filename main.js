 /**
 * 12 - Filter list
 *
 * In React, application data flows unidirectionally via the state and props
 * objects, as opposed to the two-way binding of libraries like Angular. This
 * means that, in a multi component heirachy, a common parent component should
 * manage the state and pass it down the chain via props.
 * Your state should be updated using the setState method to ensure that a UI
 * refresh will occur, if necessary. The resulting values should be passed down
 * to child components using attributes that are accessible in said children
 * via this.props. See this example that shows this concept in practice
 *
 * Documentation:
 * https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts#unidirectional-data-flow
 *
 * Exercise code:
 * import App from './exercises/12-Filter-list';
